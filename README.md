## High level goals

Gain better understanding of Javascript mechanisms to support code design, modularity, and extensibility as applied to the practice of creative coding. 

In theory I want to learn how to 

* flesh out plans for development before I start to code (sketches, or diagrams)
* Apply functional/class composition as ofter as possible
* Understand Software Design Patterns better https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern (if possible?)
